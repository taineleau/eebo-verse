<TITLE>Os ossorianvm, or A bone for a bishop to pick: being a vindication of some passages in a treatise lately published, called Anti-cavalierisme, from the impertinent and importune exceptions of Gr: Williams, the author of the Grand rebellion: calling himselfe by the name of the L. Bishop of Ossory. Wherein likewise, the malignitie of severall passages in the said Grand rebellion against the Parliament, is discovered; and that question further cleared; how and in what sense kingly government may be said to be the ordinance of God: so that it may indifferently serve for an answer to that whole discourse. By the author of the sayd treatise of Anti-Cavalierisme.</TITLE>

Clearly demonstrated from principles of sound reason, ingenuity, and late but most certaine reall experiences. Held forth under six peeces of improvement: viz. 1. By floating or watering such lands as are capable thereof. 2. By reducing boggy or drowned land to found pasture. 3. By such a way of ploughing and corneing old courser pasture, as not to impoverish it; and by such a method of enclosure, as shall provide for poore, and all interests without depopulation. 4. By discovering divers materials for soyle and compost, with the nature and use of them, as both tillage and pasture be advanced as high as promised. 5. By such a new plantation of divers sorts of woods, as in twenty yeares, they shall rise more than in forty yeares naturally. 6. By a more moderate improvement of other sorts of lands, according to their capacities they lye under, by more common experiences. / By Walter Blith a lover of ingenuity.</TITLE>

<TITLE>The visions and prophecies of Daniel expounded: wherein the mistakes of former interpreters are modestly discovered, and the true meaning of the text made plain by the words and circumstances of it. The same also illustrated by clear instances taken out of histories, which relate the events of time, mystically foretold by the holy prophet. Amongst other things of note, touching the two witnesses, the New Jerusalem, the thousand yeers, &amp;c. Here is propounded a new way for the finding out of the determinate time signified by Daniel in his seventy weeks: when it did begin, and when we are to expect the end thereof. Very considerable, in respect of the great stirs and tumults of this present age wherein we live. / By Thomas Parker of Newbery in Berkshire, and now pastor to the church at Newbery in New-England.</TITLE>

The nature of a divine right is delineated. 2. The church-government which is of divine right is described. 3. This description in the several branches of it is explicated and confirmed. 4. The divine right of ecclesiastical censures, officers, and ruling assemblies is manifested.

In which you have the most remarkable passages which have fallen out in the six moneths service there, divers questions concerning the covenant of grace, justification, &amp;c. are briefly stated. Particularly, there is presented two conferences, in which the ministers together with the truth, have suffered by reproaches and falshoods in print and otherwise. The chief points insisted on in those conferences are, 1. Whether private men may lawfully preach. 2. Whether the ministers of the Church of England were Antichristian. Both which questions were disputed, objections answered, and the truth confirmed. 3. And lastly, divers of Mr. Erbury&#039;s dangerous errours which he broached and maintained, are recited and refuted. Published by authority.</TITLE>

The nature of a divine right is delineated. 2. The church-government which is of divine right is described. 3. This description in the several branches of it is explicated and confirmed. 4. The divine right of ecclesiastical censures, officers, and ruling assemblies is manifested. In all which it is apparent, that the Presbyteriall government, by preaching and ruling presbyters, in congregationall, classicall and synodall assemblies, may lay the truest claim to a divine right, according to the Scriptures. The second edition corrected and augmented in many places: with a brief reply to certain queries against the ministry of England: and an alphabeticall table to the whole annexed. / By sundry ministers of Christ within the city of London.</TITLE>

<TITLE>An outcry against the speedy hue and cry, after Generall Massey, Collonell Poyntz, and many other renowned reformadoes. Who for appeasing of tumults, being men of much trust and honour in the army: most active spirits for the reliefe of languishing Ireland, and in the interim of combustion, for most unwillingly, receiving the charge of putting the city into a defensive posture, were exposed to some horrid murder or infamy, and therefore are escaped: wherein the Independents are purged, in posse. And all well affected to the welfare of this kingdome, may see the pinnaclised ambition of humane force, puff-pasted with more than Aristotles politicks, to procure the non ultra of their owne glory, and the non-entity of others.</TITLE>

The second part containing a justification of the present ministers of England, both such as were ordained during the prevalency of episcopacy from the foul aspersion of anti-christianism: and those who have been ordained since its abolition, from the unjust imputation of novelty: proving that a bishop and presbyter are all one in Scripture; and that ordination by presbyters is most agreeable to the Scripture-patern.

Wherein is cleerly demonstrated by histories and records beyond contradiction, that the ancient parliaments, and great councels of England, during all this tract of time, and many yeers after, were constituted, and consisted onely of our kings, princes, dukes, earls, nobles, barons, spiritual and temporal lords, and those we now usually stile the House of Peers; and that both the legislative and judicial power of our parliaments resided onliy [sic] in them; without any knights, citizens, burgesses of Parliament, or Commons House, not knowne, nor heard of, till of punier times then these. Published, to inform the ignorance, and check the insolent usurpations of those few commoners, who now call themselves not only the Commons House, but Parliament of England; and (as much as in them lies) have most unjustly excluded both our King and lords from being any Members, or branches of our late, or future Parliaments. / By William Prynne of Swainswick, Esquire.</TITLE>

That the present opposition against tithes, proceeds not from any reall grounds of conscience, but base covetousnesse, carnall policy, &amp;c. and a Jesuiticall and Anabaptisticall designe, to subvert and ruin our ministers, Church, religion.

<AUTH>Parnell, James, 1637?-1656.</AUTH>
<TITLE>Goliahs head cut off with his own sword; in a combat betwixt little David, the young stripling, who stands in the power and strength of his God, and great Goliah the proud boaster, who stands in his own strength, glorifying in the arm of flesh, and contemning and despising little David, because of his youth. In a reply to a book, set forth by an un-named author, under pretence of an answer to thirty six queries, propounded by James Parnell, whom he in scorn calls, the young Quaker. And also an answer to severall counter-queries, propounded by the same unnamed authour, whom I understand to be one Thomas Draton, a teacher of the world, at Abbey Rippon, in Huntingtonshire, ... and also he that takes his part, who writes himself W.P. who knowes not the power of God, and therefore glories in the length of time, and the multitude of years. ... / Given forth from the spirit of the Lord in the behalf of Israel against the armies of the aliens, who muster up themselves against the Lord, and his authority: by a friend to the common-wealth of Israel, who is known to the world, by the name James Parnel. Who is a sufferer in outward bonds, for the testimony of the everlasting truth, in Colchester Castle. 1655.</TITLE>

<TITLE>The constant man&#039;s character. Intended to be sent first as a letter from a gentleman in the country, to a gentlemen his esteemed friend and countryman, a Member of the House of Commons. Since inlarged into a discourse by way of humble advice to keep him from revolting, either directly or collaterally by the side-winde of being Presbyterially affected, through the mistaken and unhappy conceit, that those who have taken the Covenant, cannot without breach of the same, assent and submit unto the late proceedings of the Parliament, when as the parts of the Covenant seem to be inconsistent within themselves, as the author&#039;s observations here discoursed do manifest. The scope whereof is 1 Historically to set down the occasion and beginnings of the war. ... 4 To prove the fitness and necessity (as matters now stand) of complying with, and submitting unto this present government. For the powers that be are ordained of God, Rom. 13. Together with some animadversions incident hereunto on the same book, and on the two declarations, intituled The declarations of the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament at Oxford. The one touching a treaty for peace, [the] other concerning their endeavors for peace. Printed there, 1643.</TITLE>

<TITLE>Unum necessarium: or, The poore mans case: being an expedient to make provision of all poore people in the Kingdome. Humbly presented to the higher powers : begging some angelicall ordinance, for the speedy abating of the prises of corne, without which, the ruine of many thousands (in humane judgment) is inevitable. In all humility propounding, that the readiest way is a suppression or regulation of innes and ale-houses, where halfe the barley is wasted in excesse : proving them by law to be all in a praemunire, and the grand concernment, that none which have been notoriously disaffected, and enemies to common honesty and civility, should sell any wine, strong ale, or beere, but others to be licensed by a committee in every county, upon recommendation of the minister, and such of the inhabitants in every parish, where need requires, that have been faithfull to the publike. Wherein there is a hue-and-cry against drunkards, as the most dangerous antinomians : and against ingrossers, to make a dearth, and cruell misers, which are the caterpillars and bane of this kingdome. / By John Cooke, of Graies Inne, barrester.</TITLE>

That Christ did not bear our sins by Gods imputation, and therefore he did not bear the curse of the law for them. Part II. 3. That Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law (not by suffering the said curse for us, but) by a satisfactory price of attonement; viz. by paying or performing unto his father that invaluable precious thing of his mediatoriall obedience, wherof his mediatoriall sacrifice of attonement was the master-piece. 4.

<TITLE>Some consideration about the nature of an oath more particularly relating to our nationall covenant. Seriously propounded to all who truely feare God, and desire so to walkd with him, that they may enjoy peace of conscience. Wherein this quaerie is handled: whether the said nationall covenant hath those requisites in it, which according to Gods word ought to be in every oath. The consideration whereof is in this juncture of time the more seasonable, for the said covenant is on the one hand too much adored by some, and on the other hand by others esteemed scarce oblieging, even them who have sworn it.

<TITLE>Endevors aiming at the glory of God, that peace &amp; truth may meet together: wherein is contained the excellency, benefit, and necessity of good government and governors: a loving reply to Mr William Prynnes speech made to the House of Commons, and afterwards published. Some matters are propounded to the consideration of the ministry; and also to particular (and to all) opinions. The first, purest, best and most blessed form and manner of government, prescribed by God, (and recorded in Gods sacred word;) together with the way of entrance, or Gods calling of persons to places of chief government, the great consequence thereof. Wherein is shewed, that government by succession, from the father to the son, was none of Gods institution, in the first and purest times. And also the government by Judges is plainly proved to be the best form of government, being Gods immediate direction, most blessed and approved for Gods glory, and for a peoples greatest good, comfort, and safety. / By John Blackleach.</TITLE>

<TITLE>Plain Scripture proof of infants church-membership and baptism: being the arguments prepared for (and partly managed in) the publick dispute with Mr. Tombes at Bewdley on the first day of Jan. 1649. With a ful reply to what he then answered, and what is contained in his sermon since preached, in his printed books, his M.S. on 1 Cor. 7.14. which I saw, against Mr. Marshall, against these arguments. With a reply to his valedictory oration at Bewdley; and a corrective for his antidote. By Richard Baxter, a minister of Christ for his church at Kederminster. Constrained unavoidably hereto by Mr. Tombes his importunity: by frequent letters, messengers, in his pulpit, and at last in print, calling out for my arguments, and charging the deniall upon my conscience; with an appendix of animadversions on Mr. Bedfords tractate, and part of Dr. Wards, which seem to give too much to baptism.</TITLE>

In which answer, the severall opinions of Epiphanius, Syslyga, Beroaldus, Scaliger, Sethus Calvisius, &amp;c. for the day of Christs birth, are propounded and examined, and it is fully proved, that the direct day cannot be determined.

That the seventh day in this law commanded to be kept holy, is the seventh day of the week, viz. the day following the six dayes of labour with all people. 3. That Sunday is with Christians as truly the Sabbath-day, as was Saterday with the Jewes. / By Thomas Chafie parson of Nutshelling.</TITLE>

<TITLE>A Remonstrance, manifesting the lamentable miseries of the creditors and servants of the late King, Queen, &amp; Prince. Who vvith great sums purchas&#039;d their places during their lives, and receiving no benefit therof, since 1639. did for a long time expect an agreement between the King and Parliament. But the event proving otherwise, they by that occasion losing their places, and therewith the only means of their subsistence; therefore the late Parliament in consideration thereof, by an Act June 1649. ordained, that they should be satisfied of all their just debts due before these wars, out of the goods and personal estate of the late King, Queen, and Prince: of which also they were exceedingly frustrated, for 28000 l. in ready mony, and about 40000 l. worth of the said goods were taken from their use, and many of the said goods are still in the use of particular men, whilst many of the said creditors and servants begg, and starve forwant [sic] of bread. Yet the survivers, with the widows and orphans of the rest deceased, have just cause to hope, that his Excellency the Lord Gen. Cromwell, Major Gen. Harrison, and others, who were instrumentall in procuring the said Act, will likewise in all reason, equity, and compassion see it fulfilled; seeing God hath given them power, authority, and opportunity to do many such just, and needfull acts, for preventing the ruin of hundreds of poor families, which otherwise would speedily follow.</TITLE>

It is wrapt up in an epistolary discourse, occasionally written to Mr. Ro. Hamon, merchant, by Geo.

It contains an expedient, (hitherto not heeded, or neglected) whereby Charles Stuart may be settled in peace, if he please: whereby, we may have a better Parliament then we lost, or ever had: whereby, our armies may be kept constant to order, whilst they are needful, and in a short time quite disbanded: whereby, the peoples just freedoms may be recovered and perpetuated: whereby, not onely these nations, but all Christendome also, may be established in a righteous peace; and it hath neither destructive inlet, outlet, or false bottom.</TITLE>

Or, A messages sent to them to forewarn them of their determined destruction, before it fall upon them.

Here is also a glass wherein all formalists may see their own deformity, and so seek after that which is the substance, wherein all their deformity shall be done away. Likewise here is opened the mystery of the Lords Supper, and the mystery in Baptism; and how there is a threefold Baptism, having relation to the three fold name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; with other truths very needful to be known. All of them being laid down in as brief a manner as possiblemay be, for the use and instruction of the Presbyterians, Independants, and Anabaptists, so called; or for the good of all others who have a minde to seek God in a right way; and in the conclusion, a word to the free-gracians.

<TITLE>The pulpit-guard routed, in its twenty strong-holds, or, A brief answer to a large and lawless discourse, written by one Tho. Hall of Kings-Norton, intituled, The pulpit-guarded, with twenty arguments, pretending to prove the unlawfulness, and sinfulness of private mens preaching. Wherein the arguments being weighed in the balance of the sanctuary, are found too light; and the lawfulness of private mens preaching (as Tho. Hall calls them) viz. gifted brethren; is cleared, and confirmed, in opposition to all gain-sayers. My work in this treatise hath been, and is, 1. To rout him in all his guards; 2. To discover the weakness and invalidity of all his answers to those objections and allegations by him there produced for the preaching of the gifted brethren. His six arguments to prove their ministry free from anti-Christianism, rased; and six more asserted, proving them to be anti-Christian. Written by Tho. Collier.</TITLE>
